# GMM-MI 
Welcome to GMM-MI! This documentation is a work in progress.

Current missing features include:
- more test notebooks, including all results from the paper.
- the installation instructions (including an example calculation).

## Current state

As of July 30th 2022, we are observing a small MI bias when applying our estimator. Please check [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/GMM_MI/notebooks/bias_MI_test_D3p.ipynb) for a minimum working example, and do not hesitate to let me know if you have any problems with it.
