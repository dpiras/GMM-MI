# Notebooks 

In this folder we share notebooks with the results on the MI variance under invertible transformations. Results are stored in [`results`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/notebooks/invariance_bias/results), and figures in (guess?) [`figures`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/notebooks/invariance_bias/figures). 

## List of available notebooks

- [1_transformation_invariance_identity](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/invariance_bias/1_transformation_invariance_identity.ipynb): trend of MI estimated with GMM-MI on a bivariate Gaussian with varying number of available samples. Left panel of Fig. 2 in the paper.
- [2_transformation_invariance_log](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/invariance_bias/1_transformation_invariance_log.ipynb): trend of MI estimated with GMM-MI on a bivariate Gaussian with varying number of available samples, applying a log transform to one variable to show that GMM-MI respects the MI invariance under invertible non-linear transformations. Middle panel of Fig. 2 in the paper.
- [3_transformation_invariance_log](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/invariance_bias/3_transformation_invariance_square.ipynb): trend of MI estimated with GMM-MI on a bivariate Gaussian with varying number of available samples, applying a square transform to one variable to show that GMM-MI respects the MI invariance under invertible non-linear transformations. Right panel of Fig. 2 in the paper.
