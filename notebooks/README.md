# Notebooks 

In this folder we provide a [first walkthrough of GMM-MI](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/notebooks/walkthrough_and_pitfalls.ipynb), with common scenarios and possible pitfalls. We recommend having a look at it first, if you would like to familiarise yourself with the code, if you do not know where to start, or if you are having problems calculating mutual information on your data.

## List of other available resources

- [`comparisons`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/comparisons/): contains all comparisons between GMM-MI, KSG and MINE, as well as a comparison of various stopping criteria for selecting the number of GMM components.
- [`invariance_bias`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/invariance_bias/): contains the notebooks to reproduce the results of GMM-MI on the MI invariance under invertible transformations, as presented in the paper.
- [`deep_learning`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/deep_learning/): contains the notebooks to reproduce the application of GMM-MI to interpret the latent space of deep representation learning.
- [`synthetic_GMMs`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/synthetic_GMMs/): contains the notebooks to validate GMM-MI on synthetic GMMs (not presentd in the paper).
