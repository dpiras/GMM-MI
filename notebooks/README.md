# Notebooks 

In this folder we share notebooks with example use cases of GMM-MI, as well as to reproduce all results from the paper. Results are usually stored in `results`, and figures in (you guess it) `figures`. Configurations files to share the parameters across different experiments can be found in `*.yml` files. The folder `MI_synthetic_datasets` contains the true value of MI for the synthetic datasets found in `gmm_mi/data`.

## List of available notebooks

- [0_calculate_MI_synthetic_datasets.ipynb](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/0_calculate_MI_synthetic_datasets.ipynb): calculate MI for all the synthetic datasets found in `gmm_mi/data`.
- [1_MI_D3_significance.ipynb](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/blob/main/notebooks/1_MI_D3_significance.ipynb): residual analysis for a dataset with 3 components, D3. Left panel of Fig. 2 in the paper.
