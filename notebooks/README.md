# Notebooks 

In this folder we share notebooks with example use cases of GMM-MI, as well as to reproduce all results from the paper. Results are usually stored in [`results`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/notebooks/results), and figures in (you guess it) [`figures`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/notebooks/figures). Configurations files to share the parameters across different experiments can be found in `*.yml` files in [`config_files`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/notebooks/config_files). The folder [`MI_synthetic_datasets`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/notebooks/MI_synthetic_datasets) contains the true value of MI for the synthetic datasets found in [`gmm_mi/data`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/gmm_mi/data), and used in notebooks 1--4. The folder [`mine_pytorch`](https://github.com/dpiras/MI_estimation/tree/main/notebooks/mine-pytorch) contains a version of the MINE estimator implementation available [at this repository](https://github.com/gtegner/mine-pytorch), used in notebooks 5&#1518.
