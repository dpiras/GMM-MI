# Notebooks 

In this folder we share notebooks with applications of GMM-MI to interpret the latent space of deep learning models, reproducing all results from the paper. Results are usually stored in [`results`](https://github.com/dpiras/GMM-MI/tree/main/notebooks/deep_learning/results), and figures in (guessed it?) [`figures`](https://github.com/dpiras/GMM-MI/tree/main/notebooks/deep_learning/figures).

## List of available notebooks

- [1_3D_shapes](https://github.com/dpiras/GMM-MI/blob/main/notebooks/deep_learning/1_3D_shapes.ipynb): calculation of MI between continuous and categorical variables, applied to the 3D shapes dataset. The corresponding data are in [3D_shapes_data](https://github.com/dpiras/GMM-MI/tree/main/notebooks/deep_learning/3D_shapes_data). Fig. 4 in the paper.
- [2_cosmology_IVE](https://github.com/dpiras/GMM-MI/blob/main/notebooks/deep_learning/2_cosmology_IVE.ipynb): comparison between GMM-MI and KDE on cosmological data coming from [Lucie-Smith et al. (2022)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.103533). The corresponding data are in [halo_data](https://github.com/dpiras/GMM-MI/tree/main/notebooks/deep_learning/halo_data). Fig. 5 in the paper.
- [3_stellar_spectra](https://github.com/dpiras/GMM-MI/blob/main/notebooks/deep_learning/3_stellar_spectra.ipynb): comparison between GMM-MI and histograms on stellar spectra data coming from [Sedaghat et al. (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/501/4/6026/6121645?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false). The corresponding data are in [astro_machines_data](https://github.com/dpiras/GMM-MI/tree/main/notebooks/deep_learning/astro_machines_data). Fig. 6 in the paper.
